My first try at creating my own repository for xbmc. Thanks to drinfernoo's example. Now in V3.9, however, these are files for my perosnal use only. I take no credit for these these addons, I am extremely thankful for all the great developers who have writtent the original code. I have made minor tweaks to serve my own purpose.  If you utilize any of these, I caution you to use at your own risk. Thank you, jurialmunkey, nixgates, drinfernoo, venom123, vitor07, A4K, robwest and many others.
